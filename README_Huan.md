# R2L: Distilling NeRF to NeLF

This repository is for the new neral light field (NeLF) method introduced in the following paper:

**[TLDR]** We present R2L, a deep (88-layer) residual MLP network that can represent the neural *light* field (NeLF) of complex synthetic and real-world scenes. It is featured by compact representation size (~20MB storage size), faster rendering speed (~30x speedup than NeRF), significantly improved visual quality (1.4dB boost than NeRF), with no whistles and bells (no special data structure or parallelism required).
